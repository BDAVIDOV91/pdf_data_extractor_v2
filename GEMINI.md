âœ… Main Features
Batch processing â€” process multiple PDFs in one run.

Accurate text extraction â€” extract invoice numbers, dates, amounts, client names.

Table data extraction â€” extract line items (products/services, quantities, prices).

Error handling & validation â€” highlight missing or invalid fields (e.g., no invoice number).

Export options â€” CSV, Excel, and possibly JSON for integration.


âœ… Extra Useful Features
Configurable regex patterns â€” so they can tweak detection logic per invoice format.

Summary report â€” total expenses per client, per period, VAT breakdown.

CLI interface or GUI â€” make it easier for non-technical accountants to run.

Preview extracted data â€” let them verify before export.

Automatic folder scanning â€” watch a folder and process new PDFs automatically.

âœ… Future-proof / optional upgrades
Database integration (SQLite or PostgreSQL) â€” to store extracted invoice data.

Web interface (Flask/FastAPI) â€” so accountants can upload files via a browser.

Email integration â€” fetch invoices directly from email inboxes.

AI model for smarter field detection â€” to reduce manual pattern adjustments.

ðŸ’¡ Key goals for an accounting firm
Save time â†’ automate repetitive manual entry.

Improve accuracy â†’ reduce typos and missed fields.

Support audit & compliance â†’ well-structured exports.

Easy to use â†’ accountants should not need to modify code.

âœ… In short (1 sentence)
Your PDF Data Extractor should accurately extract all relevant invoice details from multiple PDFs at once, support both text and scanned PDFs, validate data, and export it cleanly to formats accountants can directly use â€” all in an easy-to-use package.

  To reach a full 10/10 production readiness, here are some key areas for further 

  1. Enhance Usability & User Interface (The "Last Mile")


   * Current State: The project is likely run via a simple python 
     main.py command.
   * Suggestion: Implement a professional Command-Line Interface
     (CLI).
       * Action: Use a library like `Click` or `Typer`. This allows
         you to easily add command-line arguments, flags, and
         options (e.g., process-invoices --input-dir /path/to/pdfs 
         --output-format csv --watch). It also auto-generates help
         messages (--help), making the tool far more user-friendly
         for non-developers.


  2. Solidify Robustness & Error Handling


   * Current State: You have an exceptions.py file, which is a
     great start.
   * Suggestion: Make the error handling more comprehensive and
     user-facing.
       * Action 1: In extractor.py, ensure that for each PDF, you
         handle potential PyPDF2 errors (e.g., corrupted files,
         password-protected files) gracefully. The program should
         report the problematic file and continue with the rest of
         the batch, not crash.
       * Action 2: Implement more granular data validation. After
         extracting data (like a date or amount), validate it. Is
         the date in a valid format? Is the amount a valid number?
         If not, log it clearly in the final report (e.g., a
         "validation_errors" column in the CSV).

  3. Improve Scalability & Performance


   * Current State: The processing is likely sequential (one PDF at
     a time).
   * Suggestion: Parallelize the PDF processing to handle large
     batches much faster.
       * Action: Use Python's concurrent.futures module
         (specifically ProcessPoolExecutor) to process multiple
         PDFs in parallel, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.
         This is a relatively simple change in main.py that can
         yield significant performance gains.

  4. Formalize Deployment & Packaging


   * Current State: To run the project, someone needs to clone the
     repo, create a venv, and pip install -r requirements.txt.
   * Suggestion: Package the application for easy distribution and
     deployment.
       * Action 1 (Containerization): Create a `Dockerfile`. This
         is the industry standard for deployment. It bundles your
         application, dependencies, and runtime into a single,
         portable container. Anyone with Docker can run your tool
         with a single command, without worrying about Python
         versions or dependencies.
       * Action 2 (CI/CD): Set up a simple Continuous Integration
         pipeline using GitHub Actions. Create a workflow file
         (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that automatically runs your
         tests (pytest) every time you push new code. This ensures
         that no changes accidentally break existing functionality.

  5. Database Integration (From GEMINI.md)


   * Current State: Outputs are flat files (CSV, XLSX).
   * Suggestion: Add an option to store results in a database for
     historical analysis and querying.
       * Action: Integrate SQLite as a first step. It's built into
         Python and requires no separate server. You can add a new
         module (database.py) to handle schema creation and data
         insertion. This would allow for powerful features like
         generating summary reports across all invoices ever
         processed, not just the last batch.
